<P><h3>Their work includes:</h3></P>
Putting together electrical and electronic prototypes and modifying them to correct problems. 
While they do this, they test the equipment under simulated conditions to resolve any design problems. They also identify and work with manutfacturers in order to get replacement parts for their products. Electric technicians usually work in the manufacturing, setting working in the reasearch and development side.
